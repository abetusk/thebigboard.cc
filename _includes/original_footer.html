    <p>METHODOLOGY: Year-to-date worldwide COVID-19 deaths are from <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">Johns Hopkins University</a>. Worldwide deaths from other causes are from the <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017">Global Burden of Disease Study</a>, using 2017 estimates prorated to the current point in 2020 (assuming linear growth over the course of the year).</p>
    <p>This list is not intended to be exhaustive; I've chosen a sample that includes many familiar diseases and causes of death and omits many others. Also note that grouping has a large impact on the raw numbers; "cancer" encompasses a larger number of underlying conditions than "whooping cough".</p>
    <p>Causes of death have been edited for length, ranging from the benign (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ➞ COPD) to the potentially misleading (other exposure to mechanical forces ➞ crushing); both <a href="https://github.com/joeycastillo/thebigboard.cc/tree/master/_data/deaths.csv">the data driving this page</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joeycastillo/thebigboard.cc/tree/master/_data/deaths_full.csv">the original data I exported from GBD</a> are available on GitHub. </p>
